# HW3 Write-Up

## Instructions to run locally (MacOS/Linux):
1. Download and unzip the DUONG_A15258153_HW3.zip file
2. Use terminal to navigate to the unzipped folder
3. Run `npm install` to make sure all node modules are installed (if you skip this step, the code will not run, and it does run I promise)
4. Run `npm start` to start running the file locally
